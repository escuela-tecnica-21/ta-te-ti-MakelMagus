<h2>Last works:</h2>
  <p>
  <br>
  After reading up on many forums searching for help in function declaration and similar stuff, I've decided that using C++ is a better idea, and so I'll change key components of my code to turn them into C++ instead of C. <br>
  These changes are all being made in the branch "Passage to C++", as I'll hope to understand code better once I finish the passage, and will more efficiently create the AI then <br><br>
  </p>
<h2>Next advancements will be either</h2>
  <p>
    <br>
    a) Removal of "goto" code as it breaks the whole point of making a "structured" code. <br>
    b) Atempts at creating the functions' scketches. --- Al trivial functions created! missing the board management and AI functions.

  <br>
  I'll be making changes for the following few weeks to try and create a more understandable sketch of code. This means not only general tidying up, but more specifically:
  <br>
  1) Better segregation between functions and main() code. <br>
  2) Better function bases. <br>
  3) Total elimination of the need for non-fixed global variables. <br>
  <br>
  I hope that I can begin compiling before the 1st of august.

<h2>Next advancements will be either</h2>
  <p>
    <br>
    <br>
    a) Removal of "goto" code as it breaks the whole point of making a "structured" code. <br>
    c) Renaming functions and variables to better suit their purpose.

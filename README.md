  <p>
    <br>
    Following what was talked in the previous virtual class, about the way "declare" and "define" work, I made a preliminar advance that attempts to declare all functions before the "main", and place all defining code at the end.
    <br>
    As my tools aren't working properly, and I can't properly compile, the code will not work yet, and I am only following along the process of reforming the code.
    <br><br>
  </p>
<h2>Next advancements will be either</h2>
  <p>
    <br>
    <br>
    a) Separation of all declaration code into a header file.
    <br>
    b) Attempting to generalize or standardize the code - changing CONsole Input Output v2 (conio2) to a standard library.
    <br>
    c) Attempting to make the compiler work without the standerdized code.

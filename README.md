<h2>Last "tateti_juego" modification:</h2>
  <p>
  <br>
  I'll be making changes for the following few weeks to try and create a more understandable sketch of code.<br>This means not only general tidying up, but more specifically:
  <br>
    1) Better segregation between functions and main() code. - Done!<br>
    2) Total elimination of the need for non-fixed global variables. - done, probably!<br>
  <br>
  I hope that I can begin compiling before the 1st of august.

<h2>Next advancements will be either</h2>
  <p>
    <br>
    a) Removal of "goto" code as it breaks the whole point of making a "structured" code. <br>
    b) Atempts at creating the functions' scketches.
